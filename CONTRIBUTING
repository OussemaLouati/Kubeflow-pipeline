## Contribution Guidelines

To contribute to the repository, please consider the conventions in this short document.

### Automated Code Linting and Testing

To ensure that new changes follow good code formatting standards and at least do not break existing tests, setup Git pre-commit hooks using `pre-commit`:

```bash
pip install pre-commit==2.14.0 # install pre-commit using pip
pre-commit install             # setup the git hook scripts
pre-commit run --all-files     # test the setup by running the hooks
```

### Git Branching Model and Package Versioning Scheme

#### Branching Workflow

The branching model used in this repository follows the [GitFlow model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).

Aside from the main branches `master` and `develop`, branch names are as follows:
- Feature branches: `feat/short-feature-description`
- Bug fix branches: `bug/short-bug-fix-description`
- Release branches: `release/release-version`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/hotfix-version`

#### Versioning Scheme

The package versioning loosely follows the "Semantic Versioning" scheme. 

Versions look like `X.Y.Z`, where:
- `Z` is incremented when a bug is fixed
- `Y` is incremented when new features are introduced
- `X` is incremented when major new features or breaking changes are introduced

Versions are tracked in `biobb_md_setup/version.py` as well as release and hotfix branches.
